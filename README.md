# Quizzler ‚ùì

## My Goal

In this app I reviewed Stateful and Stateless Widgets as well as learning about the fundamental building blocks of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - Classes and Objects. 


## What I have created

I made a quiz app that tests your general knowledge in UEFA Champions League using 4 questions. As one of the most popular types of apps on the app stores!

- Dart classes and objects.
- Using class constructors.
- Extracting Widgets to refactor my code.
- private and public modifiers in Dart.
- How to use Dart lists.
